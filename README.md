# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. The error results in incorrect data counts and unexpected sorting in the aggregation results.

## Description

The provided JavaScript code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline designed to count occurrences of values in a specific field and then sort and limit the results. However, there is a subtle error in the pipeline that leads to inaccurate results.  The bug lies in a potential mismatch between the field used in `$match` and `$group` or an improper use of `$sort` and `$limit`.

## Solution

A corrected version of the aggregation pipeline is provided in `bugSolution.js`. This version rectifies the issue by ensuring the correct field is used consistently in each stage and verifies the sorting and limiting logic.  The solution likely involves correcting field names, validating the aggregation stages, or optimizing the pipeline for efficiency.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a MongoDB connection.
3. Load a sample collection with data that includes the field named in `$match`.
4. Run `bug.js` and inspect the results.
5. Then, compare the output to the corrected results from `bugSolution.js` to observe the difference.
